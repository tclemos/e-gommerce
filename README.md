# e-gommerce
e-gommerce is a microservice based e-commerce written in Go

## Purpose
This project was created to help me studing a microservice based architecture 
from scratch writen in Go

I've been working in many projects based on microservice architecture, but I have
never had the opportunity to start or to plan the architecture from scratch, 
it was always already started/created by someone else and I just had to maintain
it following other decisions.

Since I was always trying to stick with the current architecture and working with
some specific issue, service, part of the architecture, it makes it hard to see 
the whole picture and to understand the possibilities available and the decision
make process to choose between tools, libs, providers, etc.

Also, I'm very excited exploring Go tools, libs, patterns and everything related
to the language. A project like this will help me to put everything together.

Go is an awesome language to create microservices, I really want to practice more
this approach using Go and this project is a nice opportunity to get better 
every day at it.

Some topics that I want to explore while working in this project:
- gRPC
- REST
- GraphQL
- Middlewares
- JWT
- Traefik
- Google Cloud Platform
- Travis CI or Circle CI
- Makefiles
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Queues
- Event Driven System
- OpenID
- CDN
- Role Pattern
- Single Responsibility
- Clean Code
- ACID
- Horizontal Scalability
- Service Discovery

Initially, this repository is meant to help me studying Go and the environtment
around this language, but it can evolve to something bigger in the future.

Would you like to study together? It would be a pleasure to check your PRs and
your help.
